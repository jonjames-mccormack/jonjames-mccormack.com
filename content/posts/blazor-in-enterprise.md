title: "Is Blazor Enterprise Ready?"

My employer and I both pride ourselves in our long history with .NET powering our commercial endeavours. ASP.NET was where I first started to see the potential of the frameworks they offered, letting you scaffold applications quickly focusing on just the parts that mattered to you.

> At Coats Digital we have successfully created and gone to market MVC and Razor web apps, WinForms desktop apps and mobile apps with Xamarin.

## Blazor WebAssembly

With the release of **Blazor WebAssembly** in May 2020, and then **.NET 5.0** in November, we have been working hard to evaluate whether Blazor is a worthy addition to our tech stack, and is it ready for enterprise?

The biggest advantage to Blazor is of course running **C# code in the web browser**. The .NET framework has been compiled to Web Assembly letting us call on years of prior experience when building new web experiences.

## Selecting Blazor as Framework

A couple of years ago we started to build **Single Page Applications** (SPA) together, and selected **Vue.js** as our framework of choice - being slightly more favourable to us than React or Angular.

For many engineers in my organisation though, picking up JavaScript has been a challenge; the advantages offered by a dynamically / weakly typed language is often overlooked as a flaw.

Blazor uniquely offers us the chance to consolidate the skills our commercial applications need, helping build our engineers into fuller developers.

> Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them.

American writer William Arthur Ward is quoted with saying "Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them". Relating that to business, having product in the market at the right time is an ever-shrinking window as your new competitors rise, and you are carrying more projects with you than before.

Engineering agility then needs to be more than how you manage your work items within your product portfolios, and now needs to turn our engineers themselves being flexible and the work they have done in one project being deployed quickly in another.

## Using Blazor in B2B Enterprise

Since its release my employer and I have been working towards better understanding the question set out in this article. Can we together challenge some of the hesitations against Blazor, and can we contribute to the wider discussion in the community?

We wholeheartedly believe Blazor is a viable enterprise SPA framework and should be explored more as a viable alternative to the usual suspects.

The proof of our belief is in the numerous in production B2B applications we have created together already, and with the many more we hope to create soon all with Blazor at their heart.

With this blog entry, and some more I have in the pipeline, I will be exploring some of the challenges and wins I have come across on my own journey with Blazor. The hope is I can give my small piece in kick starting further adoption of this great framework, and give back to the amazing Blazor community.

Thanks for reading.
